# MelodyFetch

MelodyFetch is an utility to download music from youtube with a basic interface. It provides the following features:
* Download song using youtube link
* Download song using a phrase (this will search in youtube and it will get the first result which matches with)
* Download all songs written in a .txt file (one per line)

The program is able to download all the songs you can provide at the same time, so you don't have to wait until it finishes downloading a song.

The bottom table in the interface will display the current state information for song downloads.
